Contracts are generated from `qubic/core` and the registry. Each contract exports:
- `contract` (name + `contractIndex` from registry)
- `functions` (read-only, via `querySmartContract`)
- `procedures` (payload builders for transactions)
- `createClient` (binds a query client and contract index)

## Using a contract
```ts
import { ContractTypes } from "qubickit";

const qx = ContractTypes.Qx.createClient(query); // uses registry contractIndex, override with { contractIndex }

// Function (read-only)
const orders = await qx.functions.EntityAskOrders({
  entity: new Uint8Array(32),
  offset: 0n,
  limit: 20n,
});

// Procedure payload for signing
const { inputType, payload } = qx.procedures.PlaceAskOrder({
  entity: new Uint8Array(32),
  price: 1_000n,
  numberOfShares: 5n,
});
// embed inputType/payload into your transaction serialize/sign/broadcast flow
// see /docs/broadcast for signing and sending
```

## Refresh cadence
- Contracts and registry are refreshed weekly via CI (Wednesday 18:00 UTC).
- For local regen: `node scripts/gen-contracts.cjs` (optionally set `CONTRACTS_DIR` to a fresh qubic/core clone).
- Registry indices are sourced from `scripts/contract-registry.json` (auto-updated in CI); override with `createClient(query, { contractIndex })` if needed.
